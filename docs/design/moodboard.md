# Moodboard / Concept Shortlist

## 1) Neo-minimal + Warm Gradient
- Clean neutrals + warm primary (#F76241) accents
- Gradients as subtle backgrounds, not foreground noise
- Visual priority via typographic hierarchy + spacing

## 2) Card Stories
- Each card as a mini poster: icon/illustration + punchy title
- Flat surfaces with precise borders, micro-shadows
- Summary first; ring/graphs as secondary visuals

## 3) Neon Calm
- Calm surfaces, neon accents for key actions/states
- Motion reduced to micro transitions; glow sparingly

## References
